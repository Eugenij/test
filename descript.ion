tdifw-1.4.4.zip персональный файервол с исходниками FIREWALL 
ndis_fw.zip This is simple packet filter firewall based on NDIS hooking. It contains generic NDIS hooking driver (ndis_hk) and packet filtering driver (ndis_flt). NDIS hooking driver allows to get interface list and install kernel-mode callback functions to allow or deny packets outgoing or coming from TCP/IP protocol driver. Packet filtering driver parses rules file and contains callbacks for packet filtering.  Packet filtering driver is very simple. It doesn't do stateful inspection. But I have plans to extend it
